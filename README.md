# thread-creation-time
This repository aims to simulate the time it takes for a thread to be created.
To use this program you will have to compile it and change the value of NUM_THREADS with the value you want.
For each time the value of NUM_THREADS is changed, it is recommended that you compile it again, in order to always save.
